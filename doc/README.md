## Description

This document holds the layout of the NKIA project

NKIA project aims to serve as an engine that can provide\
a set of API, either through command line or web browser,\
that can help its users 

1. more easily manage container lifecycle across multiple Kubernetes clusters
2. more easily build and deploy their cloud-native projects across multiple Kubernetes cluster (primarily based on docker-compose.yaml)
3. more easily balance out between better observability and enhanced security 

It's up to the users to find out what good those ever do to them


## Where to start

- start by reading **nokubectl** document below in the section **Core components**
